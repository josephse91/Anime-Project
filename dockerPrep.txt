There are a number of arrangements that must be made when preparing the Rails API to be Docker suitable

- Take .env file and place it into root of project
- Take cors.rb and place it within /config/initializers

- within database.yml, comment the content within the development,test and production then insert the following lines

    - development: url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'].gsub('?', '_development?') %>
    - test: url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'].gsub('?', '_test?') %>
    - production: url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'].gsub('?', '_production?') %>
